i3 window manager, for now it works great and I love the workflow, nothing fancy it just does what it needs to. Install it. https://github.com/Airblader/i3

Colors thanks to flavours https://github.com/misterio77/flavours this is a great tool for base16 but I use it to create my own themes. The most recent theme is Purple Haze. It's not to complicated you need to pull my files and use $ flavours apply dc-dark-leaf 

Highly reccomend using Flatcolor GTK https://github.com/base16-project/base16-gtk-flatcolor check it out it links to Flavours and creates your own GTK theme, although it won't do GTK4 I gotta figure that one out because it's annoying.
